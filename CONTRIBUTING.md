Note that at the moment this project is more of a proof of concept than a working product.
Check out https://github.com/kiyarose/acprox for an example of a working setup.
The goal of this project is to get a very very barebones proxy setup, however it seems that due to how some browsers work, this may be harder than it seems. I would appreciate help to get this working, but I don't expect it.
